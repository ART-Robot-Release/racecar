Overview
========

The `openni_launch`_ package contains launch files for using
OpenNI-compliant devices such as the Microsoft Kinect in ROS_.  It
creates a nodelet graph to transform raw data from the device driver
into point clouds, disparity images, and other products suitable for
processing and visualization.
